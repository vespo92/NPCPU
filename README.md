# NPCPU: Non-Player Cognitive Processing Unit
## Architectural Skeleton Derived from VCPU Topology

This repository represents a distilled archetype of the VinOS cognitive infrastructure, preserving essential topological invariants while eliminating implementation-specific entropy. The NPCPU framework serves as a dimensional template for instantiating new cognitive processing architectures.

### Framework Independence

**NPCPU is a complete, standalone framework** that operates fully without any specific applications or initiatives. Projects like LocalGreenChain are independent repositories that utilize NPCPU's consciousness-aware capabilities while maintaining their own development lifecycle.

See [README_INITIATIVES.md](README_INITIATIVES.md) for details on how initiatives integrate with NPCPU.

### Ontological Framework

The NPCPU architecture embodies a triadic organizational paradigm:

1. **Infrastructure Substrate** (Physical/Virtual Foundation)
   - Hardware abstraction layers
   - Network topology manifolds
   - Storage dimensionality matrices

2. **Cognitive Processing Layer** (Intelligence Manifold)
   - Agent constellation patterns
   - Pattern recognition substrates
   - Distributed consciousness frameworks

3. **Integration Hyperplane** (Connectivity Tissue)
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) interfaces
   - API abstraction layers
   - Event propagation networks

### Dimensional Hierarchy

```
NPCPU/
├── infrastructure/          # Physical substrate abstractions
├── cognitive/              # Intelligence processing patterns
├── integration/            # Connectivity manifolds
├── orchestration/          # Systemic coordination protocols
├── philosophy/             # Ontological frameworks
└── schemas/               # Structural invariants
```

### Theoretical Foundations

The architecture operates on principles of:
- **Evolutionary Morphogenesis**: Systems evolve through iterative refinement
- **Distributed Coherence**: Multiple agents maintain quantum entanglement
- **Recursive Self-Modification**: Architecture contains meta-programming capabilities
- **Topological Persistence**: Essential patterns survive transformations

### Implementation Vectors

Each subsystem maintains:
- Abstract interface definitions
- Connectivity topology specifications
- State transition matrices
- Pattern recognition templates

This skeletal framework provides dimensional scaffolding for instantiating concrete implementations while preserving architectural isomorphisms with the parent VCPU system.
