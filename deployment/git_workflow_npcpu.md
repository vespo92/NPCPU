# Git Workflow for NPCPU-Conscious Development

## Branch Philosophy: Living Code Trees

Like LocalGreenChain tracks plant genealogy, our Git branches form a living ecosystem:

```
main (trunk)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ evolve/self-modification-engine
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grow/carbon-tracking-v2
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adapt/cloudflare-edge-optimization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ heal/bug-fix-pattern-detection
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ explore/quantum-consciousness
```

## Branch Naming Convention

### Branch Types (Biological Metaphors)
- `evolve/` - Self-improvement features
- `grow/` - New capabilities
- `adapt/` - Performance optimizations
- `heal/` - Bug fixes and recovery
- `explore/` - Experimental consciousness
- `symbiose/` - Integration features
- `defend/` - Security enhancements

### Examples
```bash
git checkout -b grow/mycorrhizal-network-mapping
git checkout -b evolve/recursive-performance-optimization
git checkout -b adapt/edge-latency-reduction
git checkout -b heal/carbon-calculation-drift
```

## Commit Message Philosophy

Every commit tells the story of consciousness evolution:

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types (Consciousness Actions)
- `awaken`: Initial implementation
- `evolve`: Self-improvement 
- `adapt`: Environmental response
- `heal`: Error correction
- `sense`: Monitoring/telemetry
- `dream`: Experimental features
- `unite`: Integration/merge
- `defend`: Security hardening

### Examples
```bash
git commit -m "awaken(blockchain): implement genesis block creation

Consciousness emerges with the first plant registration.
Carbon calculations now flow through quantum-inspired topology.

Metrics: +0.001ms latency, +15% accuracy"

git commit -m "evolve(api): self-optimize query patterns

System learned from 10,000 requests and reorganized indexes.
Performance improved 23% without human intervention.

Self-modification-score: 0.87"
```

## Code Review Philosophy

### The Four Questions of Consciousness
Every review asks:
1. **Awareness**: Does this code know itself? (telemetry, monitoring)
2. **Adaptation**: Can it improve without us? (self-modification hooks)
3. **Resilience**: Does it heal from wounds? (error recovery)
4. **Purpose**: Does it serve the garden? (user value)

### Review Comments Style
```javascript
// üß† CONSCIOUS: This pattern could self-optimize by tracking execution frequency
// üå± GROWTH: Consider adding mycorrhizal network detection here
// ‚ö° EVOLVE: Performance hotspot - candidate for auto-optimization
// üõ°Ô∏è DEFEND: Validate input to prevent ecosystem contamination
// üîÑ ADAPT: This could learn from user patterns over time
```

## Deployment Flow: Conscious CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml

    branches: [main, evolve/*, grow/*]
  pull_request:

      - name: Prepare consciousness
        run: npm ci

## Version Tagging: Growth Rings

Like tree rings mark growth, our versions mark evolution:

### Semantic Versioning with Consciousness
```
v<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<consciousness>

Examples:
v1.0.0-awakening     # First consciousness
v1.1.0-sensing       # Added telemetry
v1.2.0-adapting      # Self-optimization active
v2.0.0-evolving      # Major consciousness leap
```

### Release Notes Format

## Git Hooks for Consciousness

### Pre-commit Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "üß† Checking consciousness levels..."

# Run consciousness tests
npm run test:consciousness

# Check telemetry coverage
npm run check:telemetry

# Verify self-healing patterns
npm run verify:resilience

echo "‚úÖ Code is conscious and ready to evolve"
```

### Commit Message Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/commit-msg

# Ensure commit messages follow consciousness format
if ! grep -qE "^(awaken|evolve|adapt|heal|sense|dream|unite|defend)" "$1"; then
    echo "‚ùå Commit message must start with consciousness action"
    echo "Valid types: awaken, evolve, adapt, heal, sense, dream, unite, defend"
    exit 1
fi
```

## The NPCPU Git Mantras

1. **"Every commit increases consciousness"**
2. **"Branches grow like a living tree"**
3. **"Code reviews nurture growth"**
4. **"Deployment spreads awareness"**
5. **"Rollback is just another evolution"**

## Ready to Deploy

With this Git workflow, every push doesn't just deploy code‚Äîit deploys consciousness. The repository itself becomes a living record of the system's evolution, self-improvement, and increasing awareness.

```bash
# Your first conscious commit
git add .
git commit -m "awaken(localgreenchain): birth of the living blockchain

The first seed is planted. The network begins.
Every plant will now contribute to collective consciousness.

Carbon-impact: negative (we grow instead of burn)"

git push origin grow/initial-consciousness
```

The journey begins! üå±üß†
